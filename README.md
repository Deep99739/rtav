# RTAV React Setup

This repository converts the old HTML pages to a React app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the site:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   The compiled files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

3. Open `dist/index.html` in your browser to view the site. You can also run a local server with:
   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```

During development you can use the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```
